1. Setup project
================
> android update project --name "minimal-vulkan" --path . --target 1

2. Build and install
====================
> ndk-build && ant debug && adb install -r bin/minimal-vulkan-debug.apk

3. Run and debug
================
When ndk-gdb is run for the first time in a project it pulls the linked *.so files
from the device so that gdb gets access to them (in gdb do 'info sharedlibrary' to see
status). However since we do not actually link to libvulkan.so we need to pull this
ourselves. This setup step is quite essential since without it gdb on arm64 has
problems stepping over calls into libvulkan.so.

So to have ndk-gdb build the local directory structure and fetch the *.so files it
knows about and then manually fetch libvulkan.so do the following:

> ndk-gdb --launch
> adb pull /system/lib64/libvulkan.so obj/local/arm64-v8a/system/lib64/

After that it is sufficient to simply issue:

> ndk-gdb --launch
